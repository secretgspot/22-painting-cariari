    "p_1": "A well-painted exterior is your family’s greeting to the community. It is a reflection of your style and your interests. A newly-painted house is a beautiful thing which can instill a sense of ownership and pride. But it’s not just a psychological effect, it is a crucial layer of environmental protection for your valuable housing investment.",
    "p_2": "I provides many types of exterior painting services. I take into consideration the longevity you desire, the protection needed, and aesthetic values.",
    "p_3": "Since exterior walls and surfaces are exposed to the elements, I choose a primer that services as a binding layer and we closely match it to the finishing paint. Porous exposed surfaces like concrete or wood are better prepared, allowing the paint to more firmly adhere to them.",
    "p_4": "For wood surfaces prone to mold and mildew, I thoroughly prepare the area and use mildew resistant paints so the walls stay clean-looking and protected for many years.",
    "p_5": "Whatever your exterior home painting needs may be, I am ready to help you."
